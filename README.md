# Facial Recognition - Aligning faces in images for better results
This guide will showcase how one can de-skew images that are skewed to an angle greater than 90 degrees. The complete alignment procedure has been divided into two parts. The first part rotates the image until a face is recognized, the second part aligns the face so as to better the odds of it being recognized. 


# Requirements and Installation
I used python to implement this project so the requirements mostly refer to python libraries that can be installed via pip.

If you are using a newer version of linux you will find that pip is no longer available by default. You can either install pip3 using the following command:

    `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`

Or if you still prefer to use pip you can download it:

    `sudo add-apt-repository universe`

    `sudo apt update`

    `sudo apt install python2`

    `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py --output get-pip.py`

    `sudo python2 get-pip.py`

Now after getting your preferred version of pip, you now need to download the required libraries. I recommend setting up a virtual environment before downloading these libraries so that dependencies from different projects don't mix up and cause problems in the future.
You can take the following steps to set up a virtual environment in your preferred directory:

1. First create a directory for your installation:

        `mkdir .virtualenv`

2. Install virtualenvwrapper with pip3. If you wish to use pip replace 'pip3' with 'pip:

        `pip3 install virtualenvwrapper`

3. Now you must access your .bashrc file and add the virtualenvwrapper environment variable. You can use any editor for this but I prefer Vim.

        `vim .bashrc`

4. Add the following text to the .bashrc file:

 ```
    #Virtualenvwrapper settings:

    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs

    VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3

    . /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh 
```
5. After saving your edit you can create a virtual environment in the directory of your choice using the following command:
    
        `mkvirtualenv name_of_your_env`
6.  To deactivate the environment, use the command:

        `deactivate`
    
    And to work on a previously created environment use the command:

        `workon`

After setting up your virtual environment you have to download OpenCV and Numpy libraries for image processing.

To download OpenCV, take the following steps:

```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libopencv-dev python3-opencv
```
To verify the installation type in the following command:

    `python3 -c "import cv2; print(cv2.__version__)"`

If you get your OpenCV version as your output then you have successfully installed OpenCV.

To download Numpy, simply type in the following command:

    `pip3 install numpy`


# Working

The logic behind the program is very easy to understand. We simply rotate the image until the face_cascade detector recognizes a face in the image. On doing so it breaks out of the loop and gives us the aligned image. 

# Fin 

The second part of this project which includes further alignment of the resultant image will be coming soon. I will also dockerize both parts so that you can sample them without much hassle.
